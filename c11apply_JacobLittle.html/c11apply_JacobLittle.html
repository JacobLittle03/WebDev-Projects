            <p>In a world where professionalism is the standard, being prepared for an interview is INCREDIBLY important, there is no arguing that.
                Before doing anything, you need to research the company and the job description to throughly understand the work environment and what is required of you.

            <p>After applying and successfully landing a planned out interview, you need to take these actions to ensure you can outcompete the rest to land a job in the world of capitalism.
                Be sure to practice out your answers to ensure that you're more likely to feel comfortable during the interview. Be sure to also appease the dress code and arrive early to give you time before the interview.
                Don't forget to bring a copy of your resume to show that you're organized and prepared. After the interview, be sure to send some form of appreciation for the interviewer to show further interest.
